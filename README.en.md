Vira-lata Caramelo (Caramel Stray Dog in a loose translation) is an app thar periodically verifies brazilian
real estate websites for real estates available for leasing based on some parameters like:

1. Total cost (rent plus taxes)
2. Bedrooms quantity
3. City area

![App overview](./app.gif)

The motto to build this app was to ease the search for new real estate for people whiling to relocate. The search
process could be exhaustive, specially when you are looking in many different websites and work all day, it could
be hard to keep tracking of the availability of new real estates quickly.

Another reason to build this was the amount of time spent by
[Homes](https://help.quintoandar.com.br/hc/pt-br/articles/360023947132-O-que-%C3%A9-o-Homes-) (a tool offer by one of
Real Estate dealer in brazil to send periodic new real estates based on some filters) to send new posts. The name
**Caramel Stray Dog** it is a tribute to Homes (which is a blue dog) and to the brazilian mascot,
the caramel stray dog, which is a very common mixed breed easily found in brazilian streets.

This app is built with tools like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/),
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

At this moment you can only search for real estates available for **leasing** using only
[Quinto Andar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br/) as search provider.

‚ö† The [Quinto Andar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br/) *does not sponsor* this project ~~unfortunately~~.
